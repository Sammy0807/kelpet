          <h3>Kelsey</h3>
          <p>
            Being your wife will make me the luckiest woman in the world. I thank God everyday that he gave someone
            like you to me. Loving you is such a wonderful thing. Being your Otsanya has made me so happy. Its even better
            than my most beautiful daydreams and most favorite childhood fairytale. This one is real, our love is real, I
            love you so much my Eze, and I will spend the rest of my life showing you just how much I love you.
          </p>
          <h3>How I Met Him</h3>
          <p>Once upon a time...it was in May of 2015..it was my last semester at the University of Houston-Clear Lake. I would see Peter from time to time studying in the computer lab where I studied most often..I had never seen him before until that semester. Whenever we saw each other, we would glance at each other and continue studying. Then one day, he gave me a long stare. I smiled at him and continued working...we were both very studious. As time went on, I started seeing him around campus more often. Then I realised we had a lot of mutual friends. We were both social and involved in many school functions and organizations. Then the following semester, in December, one of our friends invited us to his awesome graduation party. When I arrived, he approached me with finesse, captured my attention the whole night, and our conversations became more and more interesting. Eventually the bond we had grew stronger and then as time went on, it grew into love. I knew that this was the man that I've been waiting for. The one God intended for me.   </p>
          <h3>The Proposal</h3>
          <p>On July 21, 2017 I decided to throw him a birthday party...I invited all of our friends, and closest family members. I wanted the party to be outside at the pool… so we barbecued, talked and enjoyed everyone's company. Then when it was time to sing “Happy Birthday” to him, I got his cake out and gave it to him to make a wish. Then he gave a long speech about how grateful he was for everyone's support. Then the mood changed and his speech became more heartfelt.. then he put the spotlight on me. He told me how much he appreciated and loved me in front of everyone. Then everyone else got emotional as he bent down on one knee. As soon as he did that, one of his friends brought out another big cake about the size of Peter's birthday cake that read, “Kelsey will you marry me?” I was so surprised and happy! I said yes immediately.  It was funny that he decided to make me the spotlight on his special day...I thought that was very sweet and thoughtful.  I am extremely blessed to have this man as my partner and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him</p>

        <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: justify">
          <h3>Peter</h3>
          <p>
            They say when love is real, it never fades, It just keeps getting stronger with time. That is the way
            I feel with you. Married life will be more fun with you as my Otsanya. I will never give
            you away for anything, you are so special to me. I love you, Always and Forever!
          </p>
          <h3>How I Met Her</h3>
          <p>It was the fall of 2015 and finals were coming up, so I spent alot of time in the computer lab studying. From time to time
            I leaned over to chat with my classmates in the lab. Suddenly it happened! you know how you are in a room and it is a bit noisy... then there is a sudden silence?
            the prettiest girl I had ever seen in my life walked in. I was weak to my knees and just stared. Everyone in the room was also looking at her, but I noticed
            she was looking back at me. I wanted to go say hello, but she seemed so focused on what she was doing. I decided to let faith determine our union.</p>
            <p>When the semester was over, a mutual friend was having a graduation party, so I went there with a friend and since I knew she was going to be there, I did a little facebook
              recon and found out a few things about her. The moment I saw her walk in through the door, I went straight to talk to her and she was drawn by my candor, she said I was easy to talk to
              and very confident. We talked for hours unending, and it was one of the high points of my year.
          </p>
          <p>
            2015 was over, and as the 2016 new year came, I wrote a list down. I asked God for three things that year, First of all, I wanted to graduate from my masters 
            program, I wanted a job when I finished school and I wanted a life partner. Things weren't as clear to me at first, but when I wrecked my car and needed assistance, she was there for me,
            through all the stress of not having a car in Houston, then it hit me! God had answered all the prayer points I listed at the beginning of the year. Kelsey is the love of my life, and forever is not enough time, 
            but I will relish each second loving her and being her husband.
